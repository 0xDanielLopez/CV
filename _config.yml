  Hello, my name is Daniel LÃ³pez, and I am a <mark>Security Engineer</mark> with over <mark>6 years of experience</mark> working in <mark>Security Operations Centers</mark> (SOC). Throughout these years, I have been involved in the analysis, containment and remediation of threats for international and strategic clients across multiple sectors.

  Also, in my spare time, I enjoy programming, building projects, and researching threats (which I often share on my Twitter account). I have a particular fondness for programming in <mark>Python & Bash</mark> and exploring technologies such as <mark>AWS</mark> or playing with <mark>APIs</mark>. These diverse interests enable me to stay up-to-date with the latest advancements in the field and continuously expand my skill set.
